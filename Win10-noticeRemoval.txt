Get rid of Win10 upgrade notification


To get rid of the icon permanently, uninstall KB3035583 which is responsible for these notifications: Control panel, windows update, installed updates, sort by name, "Update for Microsoft Windows KB3035583" (not a Security Update), uninstall, reboot.
(Alternative: open CMD and enter wusa /uninstall /KB:3035583)

When you're offered the same again via Windows Update remember to hide it.

After uninstalling, if remnants of the update's files are still in Windows\System32\GWX, just delete that directory, although first you may need to take ownership of it.
